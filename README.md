Processing R/V Walton Smith data

The interpolation is done using the [fields](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fields/index.html) R package which has come really nice kriging methods and handy visualization function. There is an excellent [vignette](https://github.com/NCAR/fields/blob/master/fieldsVignette.pdf) that explains the main functions and features.

Underdevelopment is interpolation that takes into consideration coastlines and bathymetry.
